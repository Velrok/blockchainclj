# blockchain

A naive implementation of block chain in clojure.
Mainly for my personal learning.

## This is a pet project

I'm using this to get a better understanding of what a block chain is and how it works.
This is not for production usage.


# Development

## Mac

 - install JDK
 - `brew install leiningen`
 - checkout project `git clone https://github.com/Velrok/blockchainclj.git`
 - cd `blockchainclj`
 - fetch dependencies `lein deps`
 - start a repl `lein repl`
